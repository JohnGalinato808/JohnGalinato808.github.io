This software project is in response to the tragic disaster of the Lahaina wildfires that have occurred this year. With friends and family in mind, Luke P., Joe Z., Jeric Q. and I have been working on this application for a month with hopes to potentially be of help to the recovering land and families of Maui. With this website, users are able to engage with the community by adding their own survey's and posts to the community, view an AI generated map of the area to create model cards of (potential) infrastructures, generate AI images for inspiration and also view recent articles from credible sources with our external links page.

## I Volunteer [to] Tribute

My role within the group of astounding developers, was focused on the forum page. I have implemented the method of adding comments to a post, the capability to delete the comment, as well as deleting a post from the database collection. In addition I have created all test code to ensure all of our integrated implementations were working as intended.

## E314: Experience of the Semester

From this group and project, much knowledge has been shared with each other. The most retained for me, however, is the creation of test code due to that being a big part of my contribution. I have found it as a useful tip to create a 'utilities' directory within the 'ui' directory and have a .js file that holds all ID's of all components and pages that are created. Creating an ID for components and pages throughout the development of the software makes identifying actual components very easy. While inspecting a page's elements, the current page can be easily identified as well as buttons, text-fields, links, etc. Having an ID created and already tagged to their respective code locations also allows for an easier implementation of test code. 

In addition to learning much about test code and the utilization of testcafe, I learned how useful it is to be able to have other sources of information to comfortably utilize. Being able to depend on each other contributed to a hasty production of our software, leading to a smooth development process.
