The Teal Rope is an Airman Leadership role that covers over the basis of Airmen morality and prevention of sexual assault.

As a Teal Rope, we are expected to complete at least 10 hours of community service for the base per week. In addition, our main goal is to help anyone and everyone that is need, whether an individual is experiencing mental, physical, or spiritual degradation. Teal Ropes fall under restricted reporting, meaning whatever is said to us is confidential between the individual and the Teal Rope, unless there are factors of potential serious harm to anyone. As a Wing Lead, I have created and overseen multiple base-wide activities, leadership training taught by (retired) commanders and other officials, held interviews to pick new Teal Rope Squad/Wing Leads, and took lead over incidents that have occurred during my time in training.

From this position, I have learned many important life skills that I currently use and improve on today. I have learned many leadership skills, from approaching others, public speaking, formal speaking, and and choosing the optimal solutions for different situations. As a result, I have earned a Letter of Appreciation from the Base Commander.
