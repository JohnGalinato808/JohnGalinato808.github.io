## Major Takeaways

Through this presentation, a plethora of information regarding software development have been shared. Through our guest speaker, Director Kevin Costa, all participants in the audience have gained insight on what to expect from becoming a software developer. As a software developer, we can expect working as a cohesive team to support the development and implementation of software's. Consequently, communication is a major aspect. A team that can consistently communicate effectively, as well as execute actions promptly, will succeed.

As a software developer, programming is not the only relative department to consider. Developers would have to keep in mind the clients that will be consuming our end product. As a result, there are different methodologies that are used by different companies. A 'flawed' method is to use a "Waterfall Method" of producing software. Through this, the cycle of software development is only a straight shot of identifying the problem/requirements, designing and developing the software, test the code, and deploy the code to the consumer. Once the code is delivered, the consumer would most likely inquire for technical support. Instead, it is optimal to go through the entire process endlessly until the software is fully stable and only then can the software be released. As Director Costa said, "find the issues before the consumer and fix it."
