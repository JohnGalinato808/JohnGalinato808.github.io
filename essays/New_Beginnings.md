## A New Beginning
Beginning this course, I have never had any prior experience from programming languages outside of C, C++, Java, and Python. All of my current knowledge stems from practicing some algorithms from ICS 311 and online coding practice websites. Prior to college, I had absolutely no coding experience, so even taking my very first ICS course with Professor Moore was very interesting to me. Luckily, I enjoyed coding very much, even if I am not the best at programming.

## New Horizons
Despite the similarities in syntax and style of coding in JavaScript compared to the other languages, there are many differences in coding with JavaScript. The whole idea of JavaScript treating functions as "First Class," there is a plethora of concepts to rewrap my head around in regards to coding. One thing about myself is that I find it very difficult to learn (coding), especially when I have no background knowledge on new concepts. However, I do not mind the new concepts. I very much enjoy the frustration that a computer screen can give me. Stepping on legos and stubbing your toes while learning (a new programming language) is all part of the process that sets up my success in the future.

## New Workout Split
Outside of throwing tantrums for not knowing why my code does not work, only to find out that a single semi-colon was missing, I enjoy going to the gym to workout connected muscle groups. With a Back/Bi's/Core, Chest/Shoulders/Tri's, SHARMS, and Legs split, I can now add one more muscle group... Javascript! I intend to spend a lot of time on leetcode, codeacademy, and doing practice WODs during the week as a new part of my workout split.
