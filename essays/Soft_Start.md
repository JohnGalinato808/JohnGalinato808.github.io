## Starting with Software Engineering

Transitioning to life after high school, I had no interest or intentions of going into any field regarding computer science. It was only after having a long discussion with my cousin, a retired Army National Guard Sergeant who majored in business and minored in computer science, was when computer science became of interest to me. During the summer before Fall 2021 and after I returned home from my initial active training with the Hawaii Air National Guard, I changed to computer science major.

During the semester while in ICS 111, I was slightly confused on how to code, but eventually began enjoying programming. In some sense, people could say that I blindly chose my major and was lucky enough to enjoy coding.


## Software Endeavors

My future end goal is to be a well rounded full-stack developer that is wanted by all employers, even the 'Big Five.' I would like to specialize in back-end development, but also have the skills required to efficiently work on front-end, game dev, etc. Currently, I have many ways to go, but I am looking forward to all of the learning and improvement that my journey entails.
