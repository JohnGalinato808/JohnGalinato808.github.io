## Expectations
Prior to the first WOD, I was expecting there to be multiple challenges and concepts that would have been difficult to code. Figuring out a problem is one thing, but figuring out a problem while under a time constraint is a beast of it's own. Another aspect that gave quite the scare, is the fact that no student knows what the problem will be for the WOD.

## Reality
Going into the WOD, the experience was not that bad. As soon as the prompt was revealed, it was guns blazing. I was coding everything on my mind that made sense, but ran into a problem because I have not thought deeply enough about the code. By the time I was done with my initial code, I was about 4 minutes into coding before I found a bug in my JavaScript code. The quick solution that resulted in a +6 minute fix was to change the destination that a line of code was. If only I had thought more deeply about how my code would run through according to the WOD prompt, I would have finished with a time that would satisfy me. 

Going over the WOD after the fact was slightly inefficient. Assuming that the majority of the class passed (did not receive a DNF), it would have been in everyone's interest to just briefly go over the solution, why and how the code works, and call it a day. However, it was interesting to think about the different methods that we could have approached the WOD. For future WODs, I believe that going to the TA's practice WOD days as well as solving and resolving previous or in-class WODs are essential to successfully complete future WODs.
