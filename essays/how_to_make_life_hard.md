# How To Make Life (Hard) 5

# Journey of UI

Compared to normal computer science programming problems where there are slightly more technical solutions that include some sort of algorithm or possible mathematical computation. For example, solving problems in javascript and usage of underscore is a way of computing some sort of data. However, HTML requires a different style of thinking. What makes HTML arguably more difficult than other languages, is the fact that there is a different style of thinking. In general, formulating a solution in computer science in already requires people to think differently than others, but HTML branches off into another dimension of thinking. 

# Change is Good... 
###### _but not fun_

Instead of thinking how data can be manipulated in order to achieve a desirable solution, HTML5 requires right-brain style of thinking instead of left-brain usage like normal. Instead of manipulating data, HTML is similar to painting on a blank canvas. Questions such as "how do we contain..." or "how do we create..." would be the basis of creating solutions. As long as it took me to wrap my head around trivial computer science problems and algorithms, learning HTML will surely be another interesting journey for myself.
