## Searching for Help

  Moments when there are issues that you can't figure out alone while coding is inevitable. At that point of the coding/debugging process, many software engineers seek help from others such as their friends, coworkers, or online sources such as StackOverflow. While using web sources such as these to attain the information needed, there is indeed a "smarter way" when asking specific questions.

  The following link is to a [not so smart question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77048703/missing-file-changes-on-git-repository) Throught this StackOverflow thread, the main question being asked was not a specific question. To be more precise, the user listed the very general issue his github repo adding one push and seeing 90 deletions. However there is not much information to help him solve his exact issue. In addition, this user added more information than needeed, making it harder for others to assist. Although he did not specify his exact actions or what result he needed, he luckily was able to receive help from a single person.

  A smarter way to ask questions would be to ask in a manner [similar to this person's question.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77048599/how-to-use-typeof-of-function-to-create-another-function-with-the-same-type) This user is quick to the point, added all the necessary information needed to recieve his answer, and more importantly, this person did not give out his code. This person gave similar examples and uses that he needs to apply into his code instead. This user was having issues of using the indexof() method in C. The example source code is as follows:
  
    int f(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    typeof(f) f2 {
      return -f(a, b);
    } 
    
After, they further asked to verify that this was a valid built in method of C and further elaborated with an example method of what he was attempting to accomplish. 

Asking a question the "smart" way will help not only you, but others as well to help solve the issues that exist in your code. Being short and precise with your question, giving similar code or method that you are having issues with, and reiterating what you need solved is the way to receive a quick response from others.
